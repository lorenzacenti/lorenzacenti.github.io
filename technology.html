	<h1>Definition</h1>
	<p> a program or system intended to distinguish human from machine input, typically as a way of thwarting spam and automated extraction of data from websites.<br>
	<p>The term <em>CAPTCHA (for Completely Automated Public Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart)</em> was coined in 2000 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper and John Langford of Carnegie Mellon University. With the intent to distinguish the difference between AI and humans.<br>
	The test as a way to examine whether or not machines can think -- or appear to think -- like humans. The classic test is a game of imitation. In this game, an interrogator asks two participants a series of questions. One of the participants is a machine and the other is a human. The interrogator can't see or hear the participants and has no way of knowing which is which. If the interrogator is unable to figure out which participant is a machine based on the responses, the machine passes the Turing Test.

	Computers lack the sophistication that human beings have when it comes to processing visual data. We can look at an image and pick out patterns more easily than a computer. The human mind sometimes perceives patterns even when none exist, a quirk we call <em>pareidolia.</em>
    <br>Otherwise, the Web site administrator runs the risk of disenfranchising any Web user who has a visual impairment. One alternative to a visual test is an audible one. An audio CAPTCHA usually presents the user with a series of spoken letters or numbers. It's not unusual for the program to distort the speaker's voice, and it's also common for the program to include background noise in the recording. This helps thwart voice recognition programs.<br>

	<h1>The Crack</h1>
	<p> Basically with the advancement of technology it has become extremely easy to alter an algorithm to detect objects within images. Also with text to talk software it becomes easy to hack the audio CAPTCHA. 
	<br>The first step to creating a CAPTCHA is to look at the different ways humans and machines process information. Machines follow sets of instructions. If something falls outside the realm of those instructions, the machine isn't able to compensate. A CAPTCHA designer has to take this into account when creating a test. For example, it's easy to build a program that looks at metadata -- the information on the Web that's invisible to humans but machines can read. If you create a visual CAPTCHA and the image's metadata includes the solution, your CAPTCHA will be broken in no time.

	    <br>According to Microsoft Research experts Kumar Chellapilla and Patrice Simard, humans should have an 80 percent success rate at solving any particular CAPTCHA, but machines should only have a 0.01 success rate........YET I found a code commited to github called Torch Code, which has a success rate of 92% accuracy at brekaing simplecaptcha. The algorithm used to create the CAPTCHA must be made public, though it may be covered by a patent. This is done to demonstrate that breaking it requires the solution to a difficult problem in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) rather than just the discovery of the (secret) algorithm, which could be obtained through reverse engineering or other means.<br></div>

	<h1>Bamboozled by Google</h1>
	<p>Google creates ******* No CAPTCHA ReCAPTCHA *********<br>
	<img src="images/hacking.jpg"><br><br>Google launched what it dubbed the “No Captcha ReCAPTCHA" in December, which it claims has the ability to verify a human user by looking at things like the behavior of their mouse movements and the way they type. AdTruth believes it has found evidence Google’s CAPTCHA killer is collecting far more information than mouse coordinates alone, and that it could use the security tool to inform its advertising services too. The new tool isn't overtly labeled as a Google service, yet anyone clicking through it "consents" to be tracked by Google's cookies, AdTruth found. And while the service is intended to do only one thing — determine whether you are a human or not — it is also able to identify a lot more information.<br>
	Google is keeping its algorithms secret so all we can really do is make guesses about how it works.<br><img src="images/recaptcha.gif"><br>
	According to Perona, Botguard first takes a look at whether you already have a Google cookie on the machine. The No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA then drops its own cookie from Google into your browser. It then takes a pixel-by-pixel fingerprint of the user’s browser window at that time, pulling information such as:
	<left-align><ul>
		<li>Screen size and resolution, date, language, browser plug-ins, and all Javascript  objects</li>
		<li>IP address</li>
		<li>CSS information from the page you are on</li>
		<li>A count of mouse and touch events</li></ul></left-align>
		<br>In addition, Google’s new CAPTCHA will also make use of any cookies that have been set by other Google properties — like Gmail, Search, Analytics, and so on — in the last six months. The belief is that humans use Google's services in certain "human" ways, whereas bots do not, and those patterns can be detected.
If you delete all your Google cookies, the CAPTCHA will likely ask you to fill in a two-word CAPTCHA.
If you are using a form of anti-fingerprinting plugin, Google will likely ask you to fill in a two-word CAPTCHA, regardless of your cookies. <br>
Google is dealing with a lot of legal shit currently regarding privacy invasion issues.</div>
