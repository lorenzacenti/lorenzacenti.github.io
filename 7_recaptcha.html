Google's statment on recaptcha:
reCAPTCHA is a free service from Google that helps protect websites from spam and abuse. A “CAPTCHA” is a test to tell human and bots apart. It is easy for humans to solve, but hard for “bots” and other malicious software to figure out.

Google launched what it dubbed the “No Captcha ReCAPTCHA" in December, which it claims has the ability to verify a human user by looking at things like the behavior of their mouse movements and the way they type.
