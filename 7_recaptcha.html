<p>I am a graphic designer and illustrator currently based in Detroit, Michigan and am willing to relocated immediately for this position. I graduated with a fine arts degree in graphic design where implementation of digital to psychical materials, prototypes  and deep conceptual meaning is essential. I excel in the ability to conduct creative analysis and design best-fit solutions for multi-faceted campaigns including interactive media, web design, animation and web development. I have assisted clients in a multitude of industries to design and implement thoughtful and impactful branding tools to help grow their business. All of my personal work revolves around womenâ€™s studies and promotion of female empowerment and equality. I currently am a curator for an art collective called Sometimes Art House where our mission is empowering women, people of color, LGBTQ and artists with non/visible disabilities to pursue their artistic ambitions and network. As far as lifestyle brand experience, I interned with Urban Outfitters Print Design team where I created materials incorporating pop culture, entertainment, fashion and social movements. As well as worked for Captured Tracks, a record label located in Brooklyn, designing for the music industry. I think I would be a great fit for Chandelier because I strive to be a well rounded individual, exploring a range of clients, topics and mediums. I also have previous art directing experience for a radio station, Impact 89FM, where I was able to manage a team and work collectively with other departments. Through this I learned to better understand the marketing and advertising attributes and apply them when creating work. Examples of pitches and full projects are available on my website. I hope you enjoy.</p></div>
