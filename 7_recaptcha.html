<p>Google's statment on recaptcha:
reCAPTCHA is a free service from Google that helps protect websites from spam and abuse. A CAPTCHA is a test to tell human and bots apart. It is easy for humans to solve, but hard for bots and other malicious software to figure out.
<br><br>
Google launched what it dubbed the -- No Captcha ReCAPTCHA -- in December, which it claims has the ability to verify a human user by looking at things like the behavior of their mouse movements and the way they type.</p></div>
