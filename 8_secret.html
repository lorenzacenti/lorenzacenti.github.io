AdTruth believes it has found evidence Google’s CAPTCHA killer is collecting far more information than mouse coordinates alone, and that it could use the security tool to inform its advertising services too. The new tool isn't overtly labeled as a Google service, yet anyone clicking through it "consents" to be tracked by Google's cookies, AdTruth found. And while the service is intended to do only one thing — determine whether you are a human or not — it is also able to identify a lot more information.

Google is keeping its algorithms secret so all we can really do is make guesses about how it works.
<br>ccording to Perona, Botguard first takes a look at whether you already have a Google cookie on the machine. The No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA then drops its own cookie from Google into your browser. It then takes a pixel-by-pixel fingerprint of the user’s browser window at that time, pulling information such as:
<br>
Screen size and resolution, date, language, browser plug-ins, and all Javascript objects
IP address
CSS information from the page you are on
A count of mouse and touch events
<br>
In addition, Google’s new CAPTCHA will also make use of any cookies that have been set by other Google properties — like Gmail, Search, Analytics, and so on — in the last six months. The belief is that humans use Google's services in certain "human" ways, whereas bots do not, and those patterns can be detected. If you delete all your Google cookies, the CAPTCHA will likely ask you to fill in a two-word CAPTCHA. If you are using a form of anti-fingerprinting plugin, Google will likely ask you to fill in a two-word CAPTCHA, regardless of your cookies.

Google is dealing with a lot of legal shit currently regarding privacy invasion issues.
