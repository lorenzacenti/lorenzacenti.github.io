	  Captcha is a system intended to distinguish human from machine input, typically as a way of thwarting spam and automated extraction of data from websites. As designers we often are challenged to work as both, human and robot. Where we differ is in process and thought. Design created with intent and with visionary, something a computer cannot do on its own. There is passion and creativity. There is a fingerprint left on every project, special to each brand, designer, artist, individual. Something a robot simple cannot replicate, the human touch.
