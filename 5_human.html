Basically with the advancement of technology it has become extremely easy to alter an algorithm to detect objects within images. Also with text to talk software it becomes easy to hack the audio CAPTCHA. 
<br>
The first step to creating a CAPTCHA is to look at the different ways humans and machines process information. Machines follow sets of instructions. If something falls outside the realm of those instructions, the machine isn't able to compensate. A CAPTCHA designer has to take this into account when creating a test. For example, it's easy to build a program that looks at metadata -- the information on the Web that's invisible to humans but machines can read. If you create a visual CAPTCHA and the image's metadata includes the solution, your CAPTCHA will be broken in no time.

According to Microsoft Research experts Kumar Chellapilla and Patrice Simard, humans should have an 80 percent success rate at solving any particular CAPTCHA, but machines should only have a 0.01 success rate........YET I found a code commited to github called Torch Code, which has a success rate of 92% accuracy at brekaing simplecaptcha. The algorithm used to create the CAPTCHA must be made public, though it may be covered by a patent. This is done to demonstrate that breaking it requires the solution to a difficult problem in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) rather than just the discovery of the (secret) algorithm, which could be obtained through reverse engineering or other means
